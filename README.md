## Introduction

The software in this repository processes drone images/ web cam images in order to obtain relative distance measurements.
Multiple approaches for detection have been investigated, such as apriltag detection, feature detection and color segmentation.

## Tracking videos

The following videos are tracked using 1 apriltag detection and then SIFT detection to generate the relative vector visualized below.

## SIFT detections

SIFT detect and match on arbitrary image:
