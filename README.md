## Introduction

The goal of this repository is to post process drone images/ web cam images in order to obtain relative distance measurements. Multiple approaches have been investigated, such as apriltag detection, feature detection and color segmentation.

## Tracking examples

The following plots are tracked using 1 apriltag detection and then SIFT detection:
